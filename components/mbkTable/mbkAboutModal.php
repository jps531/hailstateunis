            <p>This table contains a record of the uniforms worn in select Mississippi State Men's Basketball games, including:</p>
            <p>- Every NCAA Tournament and NIT game in program history</p>
            <p>- Every SEC Tournament game since the 95-96 season</p>
            <p>- Every Regular Season SEC game since the 05-06 season</p>
            <p>- Every single game since the 09-10 season</p>
            <p>I feel very confident in the accuracy of the uniforms listed in this table; I was able to find photo/video evidence
                for all but a handful of games, and for those games it is extremely likely that white was worn for the games where State
                was at home or the designated home team and maroon was worn for the games where State was on the road or the designated away team.
                A list of those games are below; please let me know (via the Report Issue button) if you have any information about any of them so
                that I can update the uniform and/or remove the game from the list:</p>
            <p>10-11: vs Detriot Mercy, vs Troy, vs Florida Atlantic, vs East Tennesse State, vs Alabama State, v Saint Mary's (in Las Vegas)</p>
            <p>09-10: vs Bethune Cookman</p>
