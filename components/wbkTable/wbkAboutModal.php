            <p>This table contains a record of the uniforms worn in select Mississippi State Women's Basketball games, including:</p>
            <p>- Every NCAA Tournament and WNIT* game in program history</p>
            <p>- Every SEC Tournament game since the 97-98 season</p>
            <p>- Every Regular Season SEC game since the 10-11 season</p>
            <p>- Every single game since the 12-13 season</p>
            <p><i><small>*The Bulldogs' 1988 NWIT appereance is not included in this table</small></i></p>
            <p>I feel very confident in the accuracy of the combinations listed in this table; I was able to find photo/video evidence
                for all but a handful of games, and for those games it is extremely likely that white was worn for the games where State
                was at home or the designated home team, and maroon was worn for the games where State was on the road or the designated away team.
                A list of those games are below; please let me know if you have any information about any of them so that I can update the combination and/or
                remove the game from the list:</p>
            <p>12-13: v UCF (in Puerto Vallarta)</p>
            <p>11-12: at Kentucky, at Arkansas</p>
            <p>10-11: vs South Carolina, vs Vanderbilt</p>
