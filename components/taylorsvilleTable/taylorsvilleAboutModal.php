            <p>This table contains a record of the uniforms worn in every Taylorsville High School football game since 2011 
                and in every 2A State Championship Game apperance in program history (but not the two Class BB Championship
                appearances in 1981 and 1982).</p>
            <p>I feel very confident in the accuracy of the combinations listed in this table, with the following exceptions. In the 1991 State Championship Game,
               multiple helmet designs (including some with an "hTs" decal and/or a green shell) may have been worn; the gold helmet
               with a "T" is the one that was used for the team photo on the school wall, so that is the one that I displayed here.
               Similarly, in the 1993 Championship Game, gray facemasks may have been worn by some players. The hemlet designs for Bruce in 1991,
               Okolona in 1993, Calhoun City in 1994 and 1995, and Eupora on 2002 are approximations and may not be completely accurate.</p>
