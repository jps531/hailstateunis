# HailStateUnis Database

This website and database, created out of an excess of free time during the sports-less COVID-19 Pandemic of 2020, takes the all of the data I've collected through research over the last several years and puts in it a single, simple, user-friendly set of tables that allow the data to be sorted and filtered in a matter of seconds.

Sports included in this website are:
    -Mississippi State Football
    -Mississippi State Baseball
    -Mississippi State Men's Basketball
    -Mississippi State Women's Basketball

I have a varying amount of data for each sport: 40 Full Football Seasons, 11 Full Men's Basketball Seasons, 10 Full Baseball Seasons, 8 Full Women's Basketball Seasons, and postseason results stretching back much farther for all four sports. More historical data may be added at a later date, and new game data will be input as the games are played. This website was built using Bootstrap styling, PHP and Javascript code, and an SQL Database. It is deployed using an AWS Lightsail image.
